      <h2>How to use diffsite</h2>
      <p>
        diffsite makes it easy to compare two versions of a website. It uses two iframes, where the pages chosen via
        the first and second URL are loaded into, and allows to switch between comparison and overlay modes quickly to
        check for differences between both pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        diffsite itself is able to work offline. Simply reload the page twice to store all diffsite assets, and you are
        good to go using the tool offline. This does not work for URLs loaded within the iframes, so make sure these are
        available offline, too (e.g. when testing locally on localhost/dev environment).
      </p>

      <h4>Limitations</h4>
      <p>
        diffsite builds all comparison modes up on embedding the given URLs within iframes. This allows to include the
        full page provided within an adjustable view, and have all interactive elements in place to test differences in
        interactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, this solution brings limitations in some situations and for some websites:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Websites can block themselves being embedded in iframes by setting <em>X-Frame-Options</em> header with
          value <em>SAMEORIGIN</em> or <em>DENY</em>. There is no way to make browsers ignore this without making the
          browser vulnerable, as this is a security policy.</li>
        <li>Some websites detect screen size in 'exotic' ways, e.g. using JavaScript and specific window size
          properties.
          diffsite may display those pages incorrectly, when width detection does not work within the iframe.</li>
        <li>It is strongly advised to use URLs with HTTPS to prevent mixed-content warnings. Some browsers may block
          embedding HTTP content into an iframe within an HTTPS page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>URL inputs</h4>
      <p>
        Basically, HTTP and HTTPS URLs are supported. You may also compare websites that are running locally, e.g.
        using a URL on <em>localhost</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the URL inputs, there is a toggle labeled 'vs.' which can be used to detect <a
          href="https://amp.dev/">AMP pages</a> (or their canonical counterpart) when only one URL is provided. This
        fills in the second URL with the AMP/canonical counterpart and instantly loads it into the comparison view.</p>
      <p>
        Whenever a valid URL is provided, the diffsite URL is updated, so you can share the diffsite tool URL with
        others and the URLs will be automatically prefilled and loaded into the comparison views.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optionally, you can provide just one URL that either is or has an AMP page, and let diffsite auto-detect the AMP
        or canonical page for you. To trigger auto-detection, add a parameter <code>&getamp=1</code> to the diffsite
        tool URL.
      </p>

      <h3>Viewport widths</h3>
      <p>
        In <em>viewport width</em> dropdown, a device can be selected from which the screen width will be set for the
        iframes. A selection of reference devices used worldwide is provided to set the width of the iframes where the
        web pages
        are loaded into for comparison. The selection is based on to those devices available in Chrome DevTools by
        default.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optionally, an above-the-fold line can be displayed as an indicator for the device's screen size (see
        <em>advanced settings</em>).
      </p>

      <h3>Comparison modes</h3>
      <p>There are two modes available to display the two websites for comparison: <em>side-by-side</em> and
        <em>overlay</em>. The toggle allows quick switching between both modes, as both have their advantages for the
        comparison process.</p>

      <h4>Side-by-side</h4>
      <p>
        Both pages are displayed next to each other in non-scrolling iframes. This way both pages can be scrolled
        simultaneously within the diffsite tool, and compared in a side-by-side view.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the URLs are embedded within iframes, both pages are fully interactive. For example, to compare an
        expandable mobile menu on both pages, expand the menu in side-by-side mode, and then switch to overlay mode to
        start the visual comparsion.
      </p>

      <h4>Overlay</h4>
      <p>
        The <em>overlay comparison</em> stacks both iframes/pages and allows to choose between several overlay modes to
        support spotting differences between both pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        In overlay comparison, all click/pointer events on the iframes are disabled, since the focus is on visual
        comparison, not interaction.
      </p>

      <h3>Overlay modes</h3>
      <p>
        The overlay modes are only available when <em>comparison mode</em> is set to <em>overlay</em>.
      </p>

      <h4>Swipe</h4>
      <p>
        In swipe mode, a vertical control handle (line) is shown that allows to set the portion displayed of each page
        by dragging it to left or right. The left side shows the part of the first URL, the right side shows the second
        URL. This allows to find differences by swiping the handle back and forth and observing visual differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opacity is disabled for this overlay mode, as it does not make sense being applied
        when both pages are displayed side-by-side.
      </p>

      <h4>Blend</h4>
      <p>
        The blend overlay mode sets all pixels to black that are identical between the first and the second page, and
        highlights pixels that are different. This makes it easy to spot differences on pages that are almost
        identical.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using the <em>shift controls</em> next to the comparison views, small pixel shifts can be easily detected
        in this mode – e.g. when elements are only a few pixels off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically, it works by using a color filter on the second page in CSS (mix-blend-mode: difference). So there
        is unfortunately no way to display a percentage value that indicates how identical both pages are, using this
        implementation.
      </p>

      <h4>Onion</h4>
      <p>
        In onion mode, both pages are stacked and no filters or special controls are
        applied as in the other overlay modes. Use the opacity control to set transparency of the second page. In this
        mode, you can spot differences by playing around with the opacity and observing changes in the onion view.
      </p>

      <h4>Opacity</h4>
      <p>
        Opacity controls the transparency for the second page in some of the overlay modes. It is automatically disabled
        when leaving overlay mode and restored with its previous value when re-entering a mode that supports opacity.
      </p>

      <h3>Advanced settings</h3>
      <p>
        All properties set over <em>advanced settings</em> are stored locally in your browser, and will be restored
        when reloading diffsite.
      </p>

      <h4>Above-the-fold Line</h4>
      <p>
        This line shows the size of the device screen, as selected in <em>viewport width</em> dropdown. It refers to the
        term <em>above-the-fold</em>, which is used for the first
        visible part of newspapers when folded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be aware that this only refers to the full screen size of the device, and does not take other elements into
        account that may be on the screen: OS-specific controls, status bar and browser UI usually take up some of the
        space.
      </p>

      <h3>Comparison view</h3>
      <h4>Shift controls</h4>
      <p>
        Using the shift controls on the left and right sides of the comparison area, you can move each of the pages
        up/down relative to the other page. This helps to compensate minimal pixel shifts in the layout, to be able to
        compare the rest of the page without being impacted by a pixel shift at the top of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the arrows, the page can be shifted up and down in 1-pixel steps. The input inbetween the fields can be
        used to enter any positive or negative value to directly shift the page by that pixel distance.
